/**
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * This API can be used to make mpv render using supported graphic APIs (such
 * as OpenGL). It can be used to handle video display.
 *
 * The renderer needs to be created with mpv_render_context_create() before
 * you start playback (or otherwise cause a VO to be created). Then (with most
 * backends) mpv_render_context_render() can be used to explicitly render the
 * current video frame. Use mpv_render_context_set_update_callback() to get
 * notified when there is a new frame to draw.
 *
 * Preferably rendering should be done in a separate thread. If you call
 * normal libmpv API functions on the renderer thread, deadlocks can result
 * (these are made non-fatal with timeouts, but user experience will obviously
 * suffer).
 *
 * You can output and embed video without this API by setting the mpv "wid"
 * option to a native window handle (see "Embedding the video window" section
 * in the client.h header). In general, using the render API is recommended,
 * because window embedding can cause various issues, especially with GUI
 * toolkits and certain platforms.
 *
 * Supported backends
 * ------------------
 *
 * OpenGL: via MPV_RENDER_API_TYPE_OPENGL, see render_gl.h header.
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 *
 * The mpv_render_* functions can be called from any thread, under the
 * following conditions:
 *  - only one of the mpv_render_* functions can be called at the same time
 *    (unless they belong to different mpv cores created by mpv_create())
 *  - never can be called from within the callbacks set with
 *    mpv_set_wakeup_callback() or mpv_render_context_set_update_callback()
 *  - if the OpenGL backend is used, for all functions the OpenGL context
 *    must be "current" in the calling thread, and it must be the same OpenGL
 *    context as the mpv_render_context was created with. Otherwise, undefined
 *    behavior will occur.
 *
 * Context and handle lifecycle
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * Video initialization will fail if the render context was not initialized yet
 * (with mpv_render_context_create()), or it will revert to a VO that creates
 * its own window.
 *
 * Calling mpv_render_context_free() while a VO is using the render context is
 * active will disable video.
 *
 * You must free the context with mpv_render_context_free() before the mpv core
 * is destroyed. If this doesn't happen, undefined behavior will result.
